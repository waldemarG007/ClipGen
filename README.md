Each aspect can be customized:
- `combination`: The keyboard shortcut
- `name`: Display name in the UI
- `log_color`: Color in the application log
- `description`: Information shown in tooltips
- `prompt`: The instruction sent to Gemini AI

## üöÄ Why ClipGen?

ClipGen transforms your computer workflow by eliminating context-switching. Instead of:

1. Writing text in one application
2. Opening a grammar tool or translator in another window
3. Copying text to the new tool
4. Waiting for processing
5. Copying the result
6. Switching back to your original application
7. Pasting the result

With ClipGen, the process becomes:
1. Write text in any application
2. Press a hotkey
3. Continue working with corrected text

This seamless integration creates a new computing experience where AI assistance feels like a natural extension of your keyboard.
