        {
            "combination": "Ctrl+F1",
            "name": "Correction",
            "log_color": "#FFFFFF",

ClipGen supports multiple languages and configurations:

- Use `config_ru.json` for Russian interface and prompts
- Create your own language file by duplicating and modifying these files
- You can even use multiple API keys if you need more than 1,000 requests per day

Each aspect can be customized:
- `combination`: The keyboard shortcut
- `name`: Display name in the UI
- `log_color`: Color in the application log
- `description`: Information shown in tooltips
- `prompt`: The instruction sent to Gemini AI

## 🚀 Why ClipGen?

ClipGen transforms your computer workflow by eliminating context-switching. Instead of:

1. Writing text in one application
2. Opening a grammar tool or translator in another window
3. Copying text to the new tool
4. Waiting for processing
5. Copying the result
6. Switching back to your original application
7. Pasting the result

With ClipGen, the process becomes:
1. Write text in any application
2. Press a hotkey
3. Continue working with corrected text

This seamless integration creates a new computing experience where AI assistance feels like a natural extension of your keyboard.
